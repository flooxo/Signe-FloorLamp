# Signe-FloorLamp

### DIY LED floor lamp
This lamp is oriented to the Phillips hue signe floor lamp. Each LED of the lamp is individually controllable, which allows you to create great animations and light shows. On the ESP32 is the firmware [WLED from atuline](https://github.com/atuline/WLED) flashed, which supports music responsiveness. The microcontroller is equipped with an analog microphone, which makes it possible to send this signal to several lamps and operate them synchronously. Thanks to the great and unique firmware, custom effects, control via remote control or app, integration into smarthome systems and much more is possible even for beginners.
